                    The Default Keys are the Left and Right Mouse Buttons and the Z and X Keys, Which Can be Modified in the Settings.
                    The Discs That Appear on the Game Ccreen are Called Strike Circles. When the Circle Outside the Strike Circle Shrinks and Falls Just on the Strike Circle, Click on the Strike Circle.
                    Some Circles Have a Slider That you Need to Hold Down and Follow as it Moves.
                    When a Large Disk Appears on the Screen, Press and Hold the Button to Quickly Rotate Around the Center of the Circle.

                    <h2>Cursor Movement Seems to be Delayed?</h2>
                    Try Enabling the Hardware Cursor in Settings, Which Can Reduce Cursor Feedback Latency. However, in Some Operating Systems or Browsers, Problems Such as Flickering or the Inability to Display the Cursor May Occur, So it's Turned off by Befault. In Addition, the Cursor Size Adjustment of the Current Hardware Cursor Only has 3 Fixed Levels. The Minimum Value is Displayed Below 0.65, and the Maximum Value is Displayed Above 0.95.

        			<h2>The Game is Very Stuck, What Should I do?</h2>
        			You Can Uncheck "Use System Resolution" in Settings and Set the Resolution to a Lower Value Than the System Scaling (Computer System Scaling For Laptops or High-Resolution Ccreens is Often Over 100%). It's Recommended to Avoid Excessive CPU Usage, Close Anti-Virus Software/Computer Manager, Try Closing Other Tabs of the Browser and Restart the Browser. Please Make Sure You are Using a Mainstream Modern Browser (Such as Firefox, Chrome).
